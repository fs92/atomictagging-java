
Atomic Tagging
==============
This is the Java implementation of the Atomic Tagging API and a CLI. To learn more about 
Atomic Tagging, please refer to http://atomictagging.org or the atomictagging-docs repository.

To setup an Atomic Tagging environment, check out the atomictagging-sql repository and set up 
a MySQL database with the provided script. Then, import this Java repository into an Eclipse 
Java Project, configure the CLI via the Configuration class and start the Shell via the 
Shell class.

Please let me know of any problems during setup.
