Atomic Tagging
==============

If you read this, you've already got the sources from GitHub (http://github.com/AtomicTagging).
Get the SQL project as well and set up a MySQL database with the provided SQL script. Then, 
import this directory into an Eclipse Java Project and start the Shell via the Shell.java class.

Please let me know of any problems during set up.
